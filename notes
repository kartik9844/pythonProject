In Python, variables are used to store data values. They act as placeholders for different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, or even more complex objects like functions or classes. Here's the syntax for defining variables and an example code snippet to illustrate their usage:

### Syntax:
```python
variable_name = value
```

- `variable_name`: This is the name you give to your variable. It should follow Python's naming rules, which generally include starting with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. Variable names are case-sensitive.
- `=`: This is the assignment operator used to assign a value to the variable.
- `value`: This is the actual data that the variable will hold. It can be a number, a string, a list, a boolean, etc.

### Example Code:
```python
# Assigning values to variables
name = "Alice"  # String variable
age = 30        # Integer variable
is_student = True  # Boolean variable
height = 175.5  # Float variable

# Printing the values of variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Is Student?", is_student)
print("Height:", height)
```

In this example:
- `name`, `age`, `is_student`, and `height` are variables.
- `"Alice"`, `30`, `True`, and `175.5` are the values assigned to these variables.
- `print()` statements are used to display the values of these variables.

When you run this code, it will output:
```
Name: Alice
Age: 30
Is Student? True
Height: 175.5
```

Variables are dynamic in Python, meaning you can change their values and types throughout your code. For instance, you could update `age` to a different value or change `is_student` from `True` to `False` later in your program.
1.write p to print hello in 3 diferent ways
2. wp to understand the data types
3.write a program to interchange  a number in 4 different ways
    temp, swap, add, mul
4. wp to demostarte datatypes to know the data we use type method


IF COnditions
python supports 2 types of conditions statments
    1.if conditions
    2.loops

IF CONditons:
    if is a key word its used to check conditions for every conditions their will be 2 possiblitity
    True or Fales if the condition is true it excute ture block if the condition is fales it
    excute the else part

    Syntax:
    if(condition):
        true block
    else:
        fales block

5.write a program to read a number and check is it a even or odd
6.wp to read 2 number and find greatest of 2 numbers
7. wp to find greatest of 4 numbers
8. wp to check leap year or not
9. wp to display the following messases
    if a number divides by 3 display nam e
    if a number divides by 5 display address
    if by both the display name and address


LOOPS:
    to reapete a same statments again and again loops are used in loops mainly 2 types
    for loop and while loop

    For Loop:
        when we know the number of repatations we use for loop in for loop they are going to use for keyword
        and rage method. rage method comes with 3 different formates.
        range(val)
        range(start,end)
        rage(start,end,++or--)

        Syntax:
        for i in range():
            true block

        range with 1 parameter: when we pass single parameter to range method it consider the value as end value
        loops start form 0 till the that value not the value
10.write to demonstarte range with single parameters
11. wp to display the number form  5 to  20
12. wp to display the numbers form 50 to 30

break: this keyword is used to trimate the program we can use it as break point or to stop the excution of progam
    for a specific condition
Contiune: it used to excute a skip the excution for specific value

13.wp to read 5 number form the user
    it the user enters 0 terminate the program
14. wp to display the number 1 to 10 when values of i is equal to 3 skip the value

while LOOp:
    when dont know the number values we use while loop, in loop initialization ++ or -- in spearte liens
15. wp to display the number 30 to 40 using while loop

16. wp to demostrate break keyword and contiue in while loop
else keyword: first time in loop else key word is intrudeced in loops right now we wre using in only if .in while loop
if the condition fales

17. wp to read and display the  indiviual digits of number
18. wp to read a number and find the sum of indiviual digits
19. wp to reverse a number

functions

by using fuctions we can reduse the code and we can increase the excution speed functions are defined by using def keyword
in functions mainly to types user defined functions and built in functions
1. user defied functions this fucntions are craeted by the user according their requirements following explamles
creation of functions and its usage

20. function demo

function with paramters we can pass the parametrs to the functions functions will take variables in run time the
data will be defined

function with return type
